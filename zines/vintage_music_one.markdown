## Background

I started on the cover. At my day job I was creating tables on websites using [CSS Grids](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/), and wanted to draw using grids. Do something like Keith Haring did with the super condensed large paintings with lots of different parts meshed together. The door was a 3D element to break up the flatness.

The music elements came from things I was reading and playing around with at the time.
