## Background

I started on the cover. At my day job I was creating tables on websites using CSS Grids (link), and wanted to draw using grids. Do something like Keith Haring did with the super condensed large paintings with lots of different parts meshed together. The door was a 3D element to break up the flatness.

The music elements came from things I was reading and playing around with at the time.
